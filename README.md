# **1) Description of the project**

The goal of this project is to design a carreer service program that lets the students create an account and apply for positions by uploading and editing their portfolios. The students should also be able to search for different job offers. The employers should then be able to have login access to track the portfolios that the students have been uploading; as well as adding new openings and selecting the candidates that qualifies and schedule an interview. Finally, the admin should be able to manage all the portfolios recieved as well as managing the multiple job postings.
